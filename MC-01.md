**Nd4J**
- Artifact resolver replaced, was in use artifactory plugin, - now in use *Maven* native method
> - I think About resolver for different platforms, about like files preloading and overriding data.
But I decide to hardcode  it for a now to safe time. Appropriate hardcoded value stored at : jobs/dl4j/nd4j/nd4j-docker.groovy
for `-DrepoUrl=` value.
```
                    sh("mvn -B dependency:get -DrepoUrl=http://ec2-54-200-65-148.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8088/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots  \\\n" +
                            " -Dartifact=org.nd4j:${LIBPROJECT}:${LIBBND4J_SNAPSHOT}:tar \\\n" +
                            " -Dtransitive=false \\\n" +
                            " -Ddest=${LIBPROJECT}-${LIBBND4J_SNAPSHOT}.tar")
```
